## Overview

This is a Smart Todo List application with AI integration built as a full-stack web application. The system allows users to manage tasks with AI-powered features including task prioritization, deadline suggestions, and context-aware recommendations. The application follows a modern tech stack with React/TypeScript frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and OpenAI integration for AI capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive component library based on Radix UI primitives

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o model) for intelligent task management
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with proper validation using Zod schemas

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Migration Strategy**: Schema-first approach with migrations in `/migrations`
- **Connection**: Neon Database (PostgreSQL) with connection pooling

## Key Components

### Core Tables
1. **tasks**: Primary task management with AI enhancements
   - Basic task fields (title, description, category, priority, status)
   - AI-specific fields (priority_score, ai_enhanced, ai_suggestions)
   - Temporal fields (deadline, estimated_time, created_at, updated_at)

2. **contextEntries**: Daily context processing for AI insights
   - Content storage for emails, messages, notes
   - AI processing results (processed_insights, extracted_tasks)
   - Source type classification

3. **categories**: Task categorization system
   - Dynamic category management with usage tracking
   - Color coding for visual organization

### AI Service Components
- **Task Enhancement**: AI-powered task description improvement
- **Priority Scoring**: Context-aware task prioritization
- **Deadline Suggestions**: Intelligent deadline recommendations
- **Context Processing**: Analysis of daily context (emails, messages, notes)
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatic task category suggestions

### Frontend Pages
- **Dashboard**: Main task management interface with filtering and sorting
- **Context Page**: Daily context input and processing interface
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and manage tasks with AI suggestions

## Data Flow

### Task Creation Flow
1. User inputs basic task information
2. AI service analyzes task against existing context
3. System provides enhanced description, priority, and deadline suggestions
4. User can accept or modify AI suggestions
5. Task is saved with AI enhancement flags

### Context Processing Flow
1. User inputs daily context (emails, messages, notes)
2. AI service processes context to extract insights
3. System identifies potential tasks and priorities
4. Results are stored for future task enhancement
5. User receives suggestions for task creation/modification

### AI Enhancement Pipeline
1. Context analysis for current user state
2. Task complexity assessment
3. Priority scoring based on urgency and context
4. Deadline calculation considering workload
5. Category suggestion based on content patterns

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL database
- **AI Service**: OpenAI API with GPT-4o model
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite for fast development builds
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for full type coverage
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
- **Database Tools**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets to `/dist/public`
- Backend: ESBuild bundles server code to `/dist/index.js`
- Database: Drizzle manages schema migrations automatically

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: OpenAI API key for AI features (required)
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)

### Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Database Management**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes
- **Type Checking**: `npm run check` validates TypeScript

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
